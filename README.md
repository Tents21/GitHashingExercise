# GitHashingExercise

This Bash script is designed to hash a 4-digit integer using the SHA-256 algorithm. The script begins by checking if a command line argument is provided, displaying usage instructions if not. It then extracts the 4-digit integer from the argument and verifies its format. If the input is valid, the script hashes the integer using SHA-256 and saves the resulting hash to a file named "hash_output.txt". Finally, it prints a message indicating that the hash has been generated and saved, making it suitable for documenting in a README.md file.
